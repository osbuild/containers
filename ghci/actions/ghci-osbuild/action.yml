inputs:
  actor:
    description: >
      GitHub username to act as. This is mainly required to authenticate to
      GitHub Packages, and even in that case GitHub allows any value as actor.

      This uses `github.actor` by default.
    default: ${{ github.actor }}
  image:
    description: >
      The image to execute the commands in. Any docker image URL can be
      specified. The working directory is mounted into `/ci/workdir` before
      the container is executed.

      This uses `ghci-osbuild:v1` on GitHub Packages by default.
    default: 'docker.pkg.github.com/osbuild/containers/ghci-osbuild:v1'
  run:
    description: >
      Commands to execute in the container. This is passed to a `bash` shell
      in the container after all setup operations are done. This is executed
      with full root privileges through `bash -c "ARGS"`.

      This prints "Nothing to do." by default.
    default: 'echo "Nothing to do."'
  token:
    description: >
      Personal Access Token used to authenticate to GitHub Packages before
      fetching required containers. This is required, because GitHub Packages
      needs authentication even for read-access on public repositories. This
      might be changed in the future.

      This will use `docker login` to authenticate with this token and the
      specified actor. Subsequent docker operations will have access to this.

      If this is an empty token, no authentication is performed.

      This uses `github.token` by default.
    default: ${{ github.token }}
runs:
  using: 'node12'
  main: 'index.js'
